# bmi_ben

BMI calculator made as part of a udemy course in learning Flutter. Main focus was on UI design and implementation. 

Worth noting that I added cool gradient color schemes to the cards and also replaced the male/female toggle with a tractor/anchor toggle because its funny. Inspiration for color scheme came from https://dribbble.com/shots/16280705-Sharing-services-analytics-dashboard

~~Look at those really cool gradients.~~ Okay, worth noting that the gif really ruined how the gradients look on the actual app. they're made using flutter's Gradient() so I promise it does look better than in the gif.
